# Session Notes — BillAgent (March 2026)

## What Was Built

**BillAgent** — An automated system that processes PDF invoices from a SharePoint folder, extracts bill data, and creates bill drafts in the application.

### Architecture (7 Phases)

1. **Database — Bill Folder Connector** (`integrations/ms/sharepoint/driveitem/connector/bill_folder/`)
   - `ms.DriveItemBillFolder` table linking SharePoint folders to companies with `FolderType` discriminator (`source` / `processed`)
   - Model, repository, connector service, and API router

2. **SharePoint Client — `move_item()` and `delete_item()`** (`integrations/ms/sharepoint/external/client.py`)
   - `move_item()` — PATCH `/drives/{drive_id}/items/{item_id}` to move files between folders
   - `delete_item()` — DELETE `/drives/{drive_id}/items/{item_id}` for cleanup before moves
   - Service wrappers in `integrations/ms/sharepoint/driveitem/business/service.py`

3. **Bill Folder Processing** (`core/ai/agents/bill_agent/`)
   - **Processor** (`business/processor.py`) — Deterministic processing loop:
     - Lists PDFs in source SharePoint folder
     - Parses 7-segment filenames: `{Project} - {Vendor} - {BillNumber} - {Description} - {SubCostCode} - {Rate} - {BillDate}`
     - Runs Azure Document Intelligence OCR + Claude extraction for supplemental data
     - Merges results (filename fields take priority over OCR)
     - Creates bill draft with line items and attachment
     - Moves processed file to processed folder (delete-then-move pattern for conflicts)
   - **Models** (`business/models.py`) — `BillAgentRun`, `ProcessingResult`, `FilenameParsedData`
   - **Runner** (`business/runner.py`) — Entry point wrapping processor with run tracking
   - **Service** (`business/service.py`) — Run lifecycle management
   - **Repository** (`persistence/repo.py`) — `BillAgentRun` persistence

4. **BillAgent API** (`core/ai/agents/bill_agent/api/`)
   - `POST /api/v1/bill-agent/run` — Trigger processing (background task, returns 202)
   - `GET /api/v1/bill-agent/run/{public_id}` — Check run status
   - `GET /api/v1/bill-agent/runs` — List recent runs
   - `GET /api/v1/bill-agent/folder-status` — Source folder file count for UI

5. **Scheduler** (`core/ai/agents/bill_agent/scheduler.py`)
   - Async background scheduler running at configurable interval (default 30 min)
   - Registered in `app.py` startup/shutdown events

6. **Bill List UI** (`templates/bill/list.html`, `static/css/bill.css`)
   - Folder summary section showing file count and "Process Folder" button
   - JavaScript for triggering processing and polling for completion

7. **Company Settings UI** (`templates/company/view.html`)
   - Bill Processing Folders section with SharePoint folder picker for source and processed folders

### Key Implementation Details

- **PaymentTerms**: All bill drafts set to "Due on receipt" — looked up once during reference data loading, passed through to `bill_service.create()`
- **Bill line items**: Created with `markup=Decimal("0")` and `price=rate`
- **File move conflicts**: Uses delete-then-move pattern — lists processed folder children, finds existing file by name, deletes it, then retries the move
- **SubCostCode matching**: Normalizes decimal format (e.g., `18.1` → `18.01`) before matching against `sub_cost_code.number`
- **Entity resolution**: Fuzzy matching for Project (prefix match), Vendor (Jaccard/containment), SubCostCode (normalized number match)
- **Error handling**: Failed files are skipped and left in source folder; processing continues with remaining files

## Results

- Working well in production. Most files process correctly.
- Occasional vendor mismatches and some sub cost codes not resolved — handled by draft review workflow.

## Deferred Work

- **SubCostCode alias table** — For commonly missed codes where the filename abbreviation doesn't match the database value. Explicitly deferred ("That is for another time").
- **LLM fallback for entity resolution** — Discussed and decided against. Draft workflow handles edge cases well enough. Would add cost, latency, and risk of wrong matches.

## File Inventory

### New Files Created
- `integrations/ms/sharepoint/driveitem/connector/bill_folder/` — full package (sql, model, repo, service, API)
- `core/ai/agents/bill_agent/` — full package (models, processor, runner, service, repo, API, scheduler, sql)
- Various `__init__.py` files for new packages

### Modified Files
- `integrations/ms/sharepoint/external/client.py` — added `move_item()`, `delete_item()`
- `integrations/ms/sharepoint/driveitem/business/service.py` — added `move_item()` wrapper
- `app.py` — registered new routers + scheduler startup/shutdown
- `entities/bill/web/controller.py` — bill folder summary for list page
- `templates/bill/list.html` — folder summary UI section
- `static/css/bill.css` — folder summary styles
- `entities/company/web/controller.py` — bill folder data in template context
- `templates/company/view.html` — Bill Processing Folders section with picker
